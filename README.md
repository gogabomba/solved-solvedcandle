Mick’s Wicks makes candles in various sizes. Create a class for the business named

Candle that contains data fields for color, height, and price. Create get methods for

all three fields. Create set methods for color and height, but not for price. Instead,

when height is set, determine the price as $2 per inch. Create a child class named

ScentedCandle that contains an additional data field named scent and methods to

get and set it. In the child class, override the parent’s setHeight() method to set the

price of a ScentedCandle object at $3 per inch. Write an application that instantiates

an object of each type and displays the details. Save the files as Candle.java,ScentedCandle.java, and DemoCandles.java.
